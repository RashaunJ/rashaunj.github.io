<p>It will probably be rare that I make posts of this type. This won't be a content log, so much as a meta post concerning how I want to structure my activities. I've given my long term plan some thought over the weekend, and I think that the best way to ensure success would be to have some sort of structure to my learning. I think that by developing a system of behaviors, I can use that a basis to achieve my goals. Scott Adams, the writer for the popular <em>Dilbert</em> comic strips, noted in his autobiography that "goals are for losers", and instead encouraged readers to establish a set of behaviors that maximized the probability of success. While I don't necessarily agree regarding his disdain for goals, I do like his idea of establishing systems. <br />
Therefore that's what I intend to do: establish a system that lends itself to my learning. This will come in the form of a loose schedule. When developing the schedule I came up with the following guidelines: <br />
- No set times (although lengths are fine) for activities.
- Activities should vary day-to-day to avoid burnout.
- One day (usually Saturday) should be designated as a mandatory down day.
- Any activities completed during work can have its time slot dedicated to another activity.</p>

<p>With that in mind, for the near future I've devised the following time slots, splitting among 3 categories: physical, artistic, scientific.</p>

<p>Day A: 30 minutes of housekeeping, 1 1/2 hours of exercise. 1 hour of piano, 1 hour of Japanese practice. 30 minutes drawing. Light programming knowledge (reading). Total: 4.5 hours</p>

<p>Day B: 30 minutes of housekeeping, 1 1/2 hours of exercise. 1 hour of piano, 1 hour coding, 30 minutes Japanese. Light art. Total: 4.5 hours</p>

<p>Day C: 30 minutes of housekeeping, 1 1/2 hours of exercise. 1 hour piano, 1 hour drawing, 30 minutes coding. Light Japanese (immersion learning) Total: 4.5 hours</p>

<p>Day D (Weekend only): Light everything</p>

<p>As for a bit of explanation; housekeeping, exercise and piano are all immutable time slots. This is simply because I don't think I can effectively accomplish anything in these areas without dedicating at least that much time. As for my other goals: language, drawing, and programming; I believe these can vary a bit. I think having a rotation of time lengths every day will help prevent burnout in the activities. </p>

<p>Although this is all experimental, I do believe that the times I've laid out for myself are somewhat reasonable. If I find that something else works better, or that adjustments need to be made, I'll be sure to make and update post about it. For the time being though, I think I'll just roll with it.</p>
