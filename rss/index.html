<p>To give a really half-assed update (in the context of this blog) I've essentially gotten as far as I liked with the image corruption project. At some point I'll probably upload the small script I used to generate the images in the previous posts. </p>

<p>In other news, I'm once again going to attempt to bring some degree of order to my life. To take basic stock of my current position in life</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm 22.</li>
<li>I graduated.</li>
<li>I'm employed.</li>
<li>I'm not where I want to be in life.</li>
</ul>

<p>In regards to the last point, I don't say that in such a way to as to allude to any sort of depression, or even anger at my current situation. In the grand scheme, my life could be order of magnitudes worse. That being said...I want more.</p>

<p>More in the sense of more out of myself. The idea of becoming obscenely rich, although nice is not something that you can exactly bank on happening in the near future. I'll never stop beleiving that I can become rich, however at the same time I won't be scratching any lottery tickets or looking for money out of the sky.</p>

<p>What I want out of myself is simple. I want to become the best version of myself. Whether that be through my studies or my physical form, I no longer want to wait for my life to suddenly become amazing. </p>

<p>For as long as I can remember I've been in sort of a mental rut. I've always enjoyed the idea of exploring a field of study or taking up a new hobby, however when push came to shove, my interest has either waned quickly, or my own mental gymnastics have prevented me from trying in the first place. I can't help but think that if I don't make an active effort to force a habit of gainful work, I'll end up looking back 20 years from now wondering why I never bothered to take risks.</p>

<p>I want to attempt to keep this blog from diving into my feelinga too much therefore I'll jump straight to my solution. I'm going to adopt the attitude of "why not?" The easiest explanation for this thought process is to not limit yourself by mental blocks, but to rather engage in an activity simply because it may be of benefit to you.</p>

<p>Where this blog comes in? As of now, I've decided upon three things to accomplish at this current time.</p>

<ul>
<li>I want to be a truly awesome programmer</li>
<li>I want to learn a musical instrument.</li>
<li>I want to learn a language.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now this might not seem like much, but it's a start. The first step to clearing my bucket list is to hammer into my brain a system of thinking and doing. If I can train myself to commit to at least these three tasks, I'll hopefully have laid the framework for accomplishing what I want in life.</p>

<p>This blog will serve as my forced diary of sorts. By forcing myself to log an entry every day, I'll in turn need to accomplish tasks in order to have actual content to write about. Ideally, after a while, this process will become somewhat natural (i.e not a chore)</p>

<p>I doubt I stand alone with the fear of settling for medicority. I don't delude myself into thinking I'm sort of prodigy, but if having fun with my life means busting my ass every day for a while then so be it.</p>

<p>Hopefully I won't eat my words any time soon.</p>

<p>So I may have lied a bit. This post will not be the all-inclusive tutorial I promised on image corruption. This is more of a status update. I do have a working prototype of the corruption script, which I'm tentatively calling pyCorrupt (how creative...) As you can probably guess, the script is written in python. This is for a couple of reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li>Python is convenient.  </li>
<li>I'll probably be using flask to host the polished project.</li>
</ol>

<p>The script at the moment, is hardcoded, hacky, and altogether unpleasant to look at, however it is functional. As of right now, the script only supports .jpg images, however I'll probably look into making it work with gifs, provided I can find the proper information regarding its file headers (I'll go into this in much more detail in my full post)</p>

<p>So far here have been the few key things that I've taken from this project</p>

<ul>
<li>.jpg files are split by markers (the only marker important to us in this context is Start of Scan (SOS)</li>
<li>Hex values can for the most part be changed freely between the SOS and End of File (EOI) marker, without completely breaking the image. I have noticed in some cases that changing hex values right after the SOS marker will break an image, however I'll have to look into why this happens.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the time being, here's an imgur gallery, with my guinea pig image as well as a few of the pictures the script generated.</p>

If you're unfamiliiar with the concept, it's essentially the process of changing any image (we'll use this for example) <br />
<img src='http://rashaunj.github.io/content/images/2014/Jun/1546313_10201336792485184_751669344_n.jpg'  alt="Uncorrupted image" /></p>

<p>and converting it to something along the lines of: <br />
<img src='http://rashaunj.github.io/content/images/2014/Jun/1546313_10201336792485184_751669344_n_glitched_a45_s60_i8_q50.png'  alt="Corrupted Image" /></p>

<p>The intended affect shown in the 2nd image is achieved by semi-randomly changing hex values in the image. In the glitch art community, this is apparently known as databending. Although there are a few tools out there that can generate corrupted images for you such as: <br />
(<a href='http://www.recyclism.com/corrupt.php' >Corruptus</a>)
(<a href='http://snorpey.github.io/jpg-glitch/' >Corrupt by Snorpey</a>)
I've found that they're complete but woefully undocumented solutions. <br />
In my attempts to wean myself from creating endless amounts of glue code, I've decided to recreate this effect from scratch. That means</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No outside libraries (that related directly to image corruption)</p></li>
<li><p>No peeking at source from existing libraries.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'll consider this my first weekly challenge.</p>

<p>I'll be doing a complete writeup (with source on Github) later this week that will hopefully note both the procedure and logic behind .jpg (.gif additionally if I finish early enough) corruption.</p>]]></description><link>http://rashaunj.github.io/image-corruption-i/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">48a95b76-db32-43a0-9718-371539488ce9</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RaShaun Jones]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2014 02:29:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Getting Up and Running]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h2 id="helloworld">Hello World..  </h2>

<p>Well look who finally decided to get blogging. Hello World cliche aside, I have plans. Nothing particularly crazy at the moment, but plans nonetheless. Hopefully I'll have more to write about once I actually get started, but for now I think I'll just be satisfied that this is up and running.</p>
