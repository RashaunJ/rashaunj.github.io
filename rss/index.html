<p>I'll be somewhat brief with this post. I'm noticably tired, and I believe that the longer that I prolong sleep the less productive I will become. I intend to play a bit of catchup on things that I feel have not been completed sufficiently today during the workday tomorrow, however that is not to say that today was a complete waste.</p>

<p>My digital piano/keyboard arrived. It's a Williams Legato 88-key digital piano and the thing is absolutely beautiful. It is free of the gaudy electronic displays that usually plague most keyboards, which gives it a sleek, minimal look. It does contain several built in sounds however it is limited to five. I don't find this to be an issue, since I simply wanted something that felt and sounded like an actual piano. While enthusiasts will tell you that it's not the same, for the price range I feel this was a solid buy. It is at this point my responsibility to both curate and follow a plan of study.</p>

<p>Additionally I worked on drawing in the Loomis book however this was uneventful.</p>

<p>Sleep is slowly becoming my enemy.</p>

<p>Referencing my earlier post, I decided to start my cycle with Day A. The only adjustment I had to make was for the piano time considering that it hasn't even arrived yet. As an aside, I'm starting to notice a pattern in what these posts cover. As far as what I learned drawing-wise, it's hard to show without pictures and I don't have a convenient means of scanning images at the moment. My language learning on the other hand is very easy to write about. Additionally writing about software dev is easy considering that most if not all of my resources can easily be found online. I don't think this has any bearing on how I actually learn but I will try to stay cognizant regarding the frequency in which I focus on particular topics.</p>

<p>For today I covered the following areas: <br />
- Workbook Exercises (Genki)
- Expression Drawing Genki
- Light reading regarding general CS/Software dev concepts (read: I sat on Hacker News for a bit.)</p>

<p>The workbook exercise I covered was fairly straightforward. It gives a picture in which you have to fill out the appropriate greeting. This gave me the opportunity to work on both my vocab as well as my writing. I'm hoping to eventually commit hiragana to memory however I may need to find some rote memory device to aid in the process. The phrases themselves were fairly simply. They were basic phrases that would come up in everyday life such as すみません (I'm sorry/excuse me) and いってだきます (Thank you for the meal <em>before eating</em>). One of the things I'll have look into later is the use of the っ character used as a seperator between the first and second characters. I know it has something to do with double consonants, however I'd liek to find the exact reasoning. <br />
I don't have any issues with this format of teaching however I did become confused several times trying to figure out exactly what the people were trying to say. For example the "excuse me" picture could have had several phrases that could have potentially worked. This however is an extremely minor gripe. <br />
As far as the Loomis studies go, I'm just not getting into expressions. I feel this section will take much longer considering the detail he gives for each expression. Of course I'm in no particular rush to get this done but its worth nothing.</p>

<p>Lastly the most interesting CS-related article I found on HN was a series of analogies regarding CS concepts. For example, the concept of recursion was described as a person sitting in a movie theatre referencing their location based on the location of the person in front of them. Eventually the first/last person in the chain would say "I'm in row 1!". I don't have the link handy at the moment but I may edit it in at a later point.</p>

<p>So far so good. Progress is nice.</p>

<p>It will probably be rare that I make posts of this type. This won't be a content log, so much as a meta post concerning how I want to structure my activities. I've given my long term plan some thought over the weekend, and I think that the best way to ensure success would be to have some sort of structure to my learning. I think that by developing a system of behaviors, I can use that a basis to achieve my goals. Scott Adams, the writer for the popular <em>Dilbert</em> comic strips, noted in his autobiography that "goals are for losers", and instead encouraged readers to establish a set of behaviors that maximized the probability of success. While I don't necessarily agree regarding his disdain for goals, I do like his idea of establishing systems. <br />
Therefore that's what I intend to do: establish a system that lends itself to my learning. This will come in the form of a loose schedule. When developing the schedule I came up with the following guidelines: <br />
- No set times (although lengths are fine) for activities.
- Activities should vary day-to-day to avoid burnout.
- One day (usually Saturday) should be designated as a mandatory down day.
- Any activities completed during work can have its time slot dedicated to another activity.</p>

<p>With that in mind, for the near future I've devised the following time slots, splitting among 3 categories: physical, artistic, scientific.</p>

<p>Day A: 30 minutes of housekeeping, 1 1/2 hours of exercise. 1 hour of piano, 1 hour of Japanese practice. 30 minutes drawing. Light programming knowledge (reading). Total: 4.5 hours</p>

<p>Day B: 30 minutes of housekeeping, 1 1/2 hours of exercise. 1 hour of piano, 1 hour coding, 30 minutes Japanese. Light art. Total: 4.5 hours</p>

<p>Day C: 30 minutes of housekeeping, 1 1/2 hours of exercise. 1 hour piano, 1 hour drawing, 30 minutes coding. Light Japanese (immersion learning) Total: 4.5 hours</p>

<p>Day D (Weekend only): Light everything</p>

<p>As for a bit of explanation; housekeeping, exercise and piano are all immutable time slots. This is simply because I don't think I can effectively accomplish anything in these areas without dedicating at least that much time. As for my other goals: language, drawing, and programming; I believe these can vary a bit. I think having a rotation of time lengths every day will help prevent burnout in the activities. </p>

<p>Although this is all experimental, I do believe that the times I've laid out for myself are somewhat reasonable. If I find that something else works better, or that adjustments need to be made, I'll be sure to make and update post about it. For the time being though, I think I'll just roll with it.</p>

<p>Finally pulled the trigger on a new digital piano. The one in particular I settled on is a Williams Legato 88-key digital piano. For the price range it seems like a good choice. The form factor simple and elegant while and also has including any features that I feel would be necessary as a beginner. Looking forward to including my endevaours with that into these posts.</p>

<p>As for today...I continued learning from the Genki book. I haven't begun yet on the workbook content but I'll probably get to that tomorrow. As for what I actually learned....a mish mash of things to be honest. This chapter wentt over a lot of situational content. For example, when being unsure about what you're about to say one would usually say ano (あの). The main thing I focsed on today was the numbering system which is simple enought o learn. From one to ten the order goes (in romaji): ichi. ni, san. yon, go, roku, nana, hachi, kyuu, juu. From 10+ you append X-juu(number) to form the number. So for example 27 would be ichijuu-nana. This pattern remains the same until 100+, in which I'm completely unfamiliar.</p>

<p>Additionally other tidbits like using the particle no (ね) can be used a either a seperator for telephone numbers or a common way to assign ownership in a sentence. </p>

<p>I feel like I am making slow but steady progess. Hopefully 4 years from now I'll enjoy the results of my work.</p>

<p>This post will be on the more brief side of things. This is in part due to the fact that not much in the way of content was completed for today. I still <em>technically</em> got through my list for today, but it was in such a way that you immediately know that it could have been done in a much better fashion. I already know the cause for the this, but it is outside the context of this blog. Today I worked on two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hiragana practice</li>
<li>Drawing via Loomis</li>
</ul>

<p>I found an online flashcard application which uses the hiragana chart. This did not includes diacritical sounds nor contracted sounds however it served its purpose. Because I'm still learning, the excercise took more time than participated. One thing that I picked up is that I'm having a bit of difficulty picked up the different writing styles of hiragana. Not so much the formation of them in a sentence but how they are actually written. For example, two people may write the letter R in two distinct styles, however a person fluent in English will be able to distinguish the letter R no matter how sloppy/different the penmanship. I'll need to not only look at the style used in Genki but also online to get a firmer grasp on the letters. Hopefully in a few weeks time I'll be able to remember a good chunk of the hiragana and finally move on to katakana/kanji.</p>

<p>Loomis was rather uneventful simply because I didn't dedicate (too) much time to my drawing. I'll have to make up that time (probably at work). </p>

<p>On the topic of future talk, I have a fairly exciting purchase to make tomorrow. I'll finally be able to get a digital piano that I've had my eye on. In about a week's time I'll probably do a full rundown on how that went. Until then I'll focus on making a solid schedule for my studies. <br />
(oh an a final sidenote, I tend to write these fairly late, so the actual post date keeps being out of sync. I feel like that will become irksome eventuall)</p>

<p>Today I decided to focus more on my studies in the <em>Genki Japanese I</em> book. Due to a decent amount of procrastination I was unable to get to the workbook content however I did complete the first chapter. Today I actually ended up building a backlog of exactly one activity on my checklist for the day. Although it's fairly minor I'd rather not make a habit out of it. On the main itinerary for today:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run</li>
<li>Continue Japanese study.</li>
<li>Misc house tasks (will for the most part omit these in future posts due to thematic issues regarding the blog.)</li>
<li>This blog post</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to running/working out being fairly uneventful, the meat of this post will focus on me breaking down what I learned today in Genki.</p>

<p>Chapter 1 mainly revolves around basic vocabulary and sentence structure. I'm still attempting to remember hiragana (diacratrics &amp; contracted sounds included) although that may take a while. Kanji and katakana will most likely take even longer to remember. That aside, the chapter itself went over a few key topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sentence composition.</li>
<li>Question forming</li>
<li>Noun composition.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fair warning, I'm still completely new to this so my phrases may or may not be completely wrong.</p>

<p>To briefly form my thoughts on each, I was surprised to learn that the concept of declaring a subject before the actual statement is fairly uncommon. For example the statement "I am a student" in English, translates to がくせい です。 or (I am) a student. Unless there is a specific need to specify the subject, it is usually just implied.</p>

<p>In the case where I would want to make clear the subject I can use the particle word <em>wa</em> to make that distinction. To my understanding, particle words exists to help structure a sentence. For example the sentence はな さん は せんせい です。(Hana-san is a teacher) uses the particle wa (は)( typically the ha symbol is used in place for wa when used as a particle) connects the subject and the actual meat of the sentence.</p>

<p>Additionally forming a question seems to be easy since you simply add ka (か) to the end of a sentence, so the sentence せんせい です (I am a teacher) becomes せんせい ですか (Are you a teacher). As a side note, the book advises that question marks aren't typically used at the end of sentences, however online sources have conflicting opinions especially when including informal discussions. I'll have to look into that.</p>

<p>Finally in order to uses nouns the particle word no (の) is used in order to make the distinction so the phrase きょん くん の でんわ roughly translates to Kyon kun's phone. (or if we want to make Haruhi fans upset, きょん くん でんわ which is simply Kyon-kun Denwa~)</p>

<p>Japanese is definitely not something I'm going to learn overnight. I have issues dealing with the idea of looking at years of study. I just have a hard time visualizing timescales that large, even for things that I'm passionate about. For that reason, I'll simply continue to grind at these lessons/activies one day at a time. (How cliche...)</p>

This isn't to say that I have renegged on my endeavour whatsoever, in fact it's quite the opposite. I was able to accomplish my goals for to today in sub-optimal conditions which I feel is worth note. With the exception of running (due to time constraints) I hit every target area for today.</p>

<p>For the sake of logistics I believe I'll structure these posts according to the following criteria:</p>

<ol>
<li>Briefing  </li>
<li>Target areas of study/performance  </li>
<li>Explanations/Challenges</li>
</ol>

<p>For today, I decide on touching the following activities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Drawing (In this case working through Loomis' <em>Fun with a pencil</em>.</li>
<li>Japanese vocab (hiragana practice)</li>
<li>Onset detection.</li>
</ul>

<p>For each I dedicated 30 minutes to one hour of practice. Although for anyone seriously interested in any of the above, this may not seem sufficient, one must remember that I plan on working at this for a significant amount of time.</p>

<p>The first two activities completed uneventfully, however I am at this point highly interested in the topic of onset detection and in a slightly broader scope, signal processing. I've worked with the concept before in a game-design class in order to make a rhythm reliant game, however the game itself was hacky and didn't touch the topic in a depth that I felt satisfied with. Onset detection will most likely be a recurring topic for my study. The actual implementation of this is yet to be decided.</p>

<p>On a somewhat personal note, I'm glad this project didn't immediately fizzle as many of my shower thoughts do.</p>

<p>To give a really half-assed update (in the context of this blog) I've essentially gotten as far as I liked with the image corruption project. At some point I'll probably upload the small script I used to generate the images in the previous posts. </p>

<p>In other news, I'm once again going to attempt to bring some degree of order to my life. To take basic stock of my current position in life</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm 22.</li>
<li>I graduated.</li>
<li>I'm employed.</li>
<li>I'm not where I want to be in life.</li>
</ul>

<p>In regards to the last point, I don't say that in such a way to as to allude to any sort of depression, or even anger at my current situation. In the grand scheme, my life could be order of magnitudes worse. That being said...I want more.</p>

<p>More in the sense of more out of myself. The idea of becoming obscenely rich, although nice is not something that you can exactly bank on happening in the near future. I'll never stop beleiving that I can become rich, however at the same time I won't be scratching any lottery tickets or looking for money out of the sky.</p>

<p>What I want out of myself is simple. I want to become the best version of myself. Whether that be through my studies or my physical form, I no longer want to wait for my life to suddenly become amazing. </p>

<p>For as long as I can remember I've been in sort of a mental rut. I've always enjoyed the idea of exploring a field of study or taking up a new hobby, however when push came to shove, my interest has either waned quickly, or my own mental gymnastics have prevented me from trying in the first place. I can't help but think that if I don't make an active effort to force a habit of gainful work, I'll end up looking back 20 years from now wondering why I never bothered to take risks.</p>

<p>I want to attempt to keep this blog from diving into my feelinga too much therefore I'll jump straight to my solution. I'm going to adopt the attitude of "why not?" The easiest explanation for this thought process is to not limit yourself by mental blocks, but to rather engage in an activity simply because it may be of benefit to you.</p>

<p>Where this blog comes in? As of now, I've decided upon three things to accomplish at this current time.</p>

<ul>
<li>I want to be a truly awesome programmer</li>
<li>I want to learn a musical instrument.</li>
<li>I want to learn a language.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now this might not seem like much, but it's a start. The first step to clearing my bucket list is to hammer into my brain a system of thinking and doing. If I can train myself to commit to at least these three tasks, I'll hopefully have laid the framework for accomplishing what I want in life.</p>

<p>This blog will serve as my forced diary of sorts. By forcing myself to log an entry every day, I'll in turn need to accomplish tasks in order to have actual content to write about. Ideally, after a while, this process will become somewhat natural (i.e not a chore)</p>

<p>I doubt I stand alone with the fear of settling for medicority. I don't delude myself into thinking I'm sort of prodigy, but if having fun with my life means busting my ass every day for a while then so be it.</p>

<p>Hopefully I won't eat my words any time soon.</p>

<p>So I may have lied a bit. This post will not be the all-inclusive tutorial I promised on image corruption. This is more of a status update. I do have a working prototype of the corruption script, which I'm tentatively calling pyCorrupt (how creative...) As you can probably guess, the script is written in python. This is for a couple of reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li>Python is convenient.  </li>
<li>I'll probably be using flask to host the polished project.</li>
</ol>

<p>The script at the moment, is hardcoded, hacky, and altogether unpleasant to look at, however it is functional. As of right now, the script only supports .jpg images, however I'll probably look into making it work with gifs, provided I can find the proper information regarding its file headers (I'll go into this in much more detail in my full post)</p>

<p>So far here have been the few key things that I've taken from this project</p>

<ul>
<li>.jpg files are split by markers (the only marker important to us in this context is Start of Scan (SOS)</li>
<li>Hex values can for the most part be changed freely between the SOS and End of File (EOI) marker, without completely breaking the image. I have noticed in some cases that changing hex values right after the SOS marker will break an image, however I'll have to look into why this happens.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the time being, here's an imgur gallery, with my guinea pig image as well as a few of the pictures the script generated.</p>

If you're unfamiliiar with the concept, it's essentially the process of changing any image (we'll use this for example) <br />
<img src='http://rashaunj.github.io/content/images/2014/Jun/1546313_10201336792485184_751669344_n.jpg'  alt="Uncorrupted image" /></p>

<p>and converting it to something along the lines of: <br />
<img src='http://rashaunj.github.io/content/images/2014/Jun/1546313_10201336792485184_751669344_n_glitched_a45_s60_i8_q50.png'  alt="Corrupted Image" /></p>

<p>The intended affect shown in the 2nd image is achieved by semi-randomly changing hex values in the image. In the glitch art community, this is apparently known as databending. Although there are a few tools out there that can generate corrupted images for you such as: <br />
(<a href='http://www.recyclism.com/corrupt.php' >Corruptus</a>)
(<a href='http://snorpey.github.io/jpg-glitch/' >Corrupt by Snorpey</a>)
I've found that they're complete but woefully undocumented solutions. <br />
In my attempts to wean myself from creating endless amounts of glue code, I've decided to recreate this effect from scratch. That means</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No outside libraries (that related directly to image corruption)</p></li>
<li><p>No peeking at source from existing libraries.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'll consider this my first weekly challenge.</p>

<p>I'll be doing a complete writeup (with source on Github) later this week that will hopefully note both the procedure and logic behind .jpg (.gif additionally if I finish early enough) corruption.</p>]]></description><link>http://rashaunj.github.io/image-corruption-i/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">48a95b76-db32-43a0-9718-371539488ce9</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RaShaun Jones]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2014 02:29:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Getting Up and Running]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h2 id="helloworld">Hello World..  </h2>
