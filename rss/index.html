If you're unfamiliiar with the concept, it's essentially the process of changing any image (we'll use this for example) <br />

<p>and converting it to something along the lines of: <br />

<p>The intended affect shown in the 2nd image is achieved by semi-randomly changing hex values in the image. In the glitch art community, this is apparently known as databending. Although there are a few tools out there that can generate corrupted images for you such as: <br />
(<a href='http://www.recyclism.com/corrupt.php' >Corruptus</a>)
(<a href='http://snorpey.github.io/jpg-glitch/' >Corrupt by Snorpey</a>)
I've found that they're complete but woefully undocumented solutions. <br />
In my attempts to wean myself from creating endless amounts of glue code, I've decided to recreate this effect from scratch. That means</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No outside libraries (that related directly to image corruption)</p></li>
<li><p>No peeking at source from existing libraries.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'll consider this my first weekly challenge.</p>

<p>I'll be doing a complete writeup (with source on Github) later this week that will hopefully note both the procedure and logic behind .jpg (.gif additionally if I finish early enough) corruption.</p>]]></description><link>http://rashaunj.github.io/image-corruption-i/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">48a95b76-db32-43a0-9718-371539488ce9</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[RaShaun Jones]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2014 02:29:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Getting Up and Running]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h2 id="helloworld">Hello World..  </h2>

<p>Well look who finally decided to get blogging. Hello World cliche aside, I have plans. Nothing particularly crazy at the moment, but plans nonetheless. Hopefully I'll have more to write about once I actually get started, but for now I think I'll just be satisfied that this is up and running.</p>
