                <p>I think the most pertinent lesson of today is that not everything goes according to schedule. This isn't to say that I have renegged on my endeavour whatsoever, in fact it's quite the opposite. I was able to accomplish my goals for to today in sub-optimal conditions which I feel is worth note. With the exception of running (due to time constraints) I hit every target area for today.</p>

<p>For the sake of logistics I believe I'll structure these posts according to the following criteria:</p>

<ol>
<li>Briefing  </li>
<li>Target areas of study/performance  </li>
<li>Explanations/Challenges</li>
</ol>

<p>For today, I decide on touching the following activities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Drawing (In this case working through Loomis' <em>Fun with a pencil</em>.</li>
<li>Japanese vocab (hiragana practice)</li>
<li>Onset detection.</li>
</ul>

<p>For each I dedicated 30 minutes to one hour of practice. Although for anyone seriously interested in any of the above, this may not seem sufficient, one must remember that I plan on working at this for a significant amount of time.</p>

<p>The first two activities completed uneventfully, however I am at this point highly interested in the topic of onset detection and in a slightly broader scope, signal processing. I've worked with the concept before in a game-design class in order to make a rhythm reliant game, however the game itself was hacky and didn't touch the topic in a depth that I felt satisfied with. Onset detection will most likely be a recurring topic for my study. The actual implementation of this is yet to be decided.</p>

<p>On a somewhat personal note, I'm glad this project didn't immediately fizzle as many of my shower thoughts do.</p>
