<p>Today I decided to focus more on my studies in the <em>Genki Japanese I</em> book. Due to a decent amount of procrastination I was unable to get to the workbook content however I did complete the first chapter. Today I actually ended up building a backlog of exactly one activity on my checklist for the day. Although it's fairly minor I'd rather not make a habit out of it. On the main itinerary for today:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run</li>
<li>Continue Japanese study.</li>
<li>Misc house tasks (will for the most part omit these in future posts due to thematic issues regarding the blog.)</li>
<li>This blog post</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to running/working out being fairly uneventful, the meat of this post will focus on me breaking down what I learned today in Genki.</p>

<p>Chapter 1 mainly revolves around basic vocabulary and sentence structure. I'm still attempting to remember hiragana (diacratrics &amp; contracted sounds included) although that may take a while. Kanji and katakana will most likely take even longer to remember. That aside, the chapter itself went over a few key topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sentence composition.</li>
<li>Question forming</li>
<li>Noun composition.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fair warning, I'm still completely new to this so my phrases may or may not be completely wrong.</p>

<p>To briefly form my thoughts on each, I was surprised to learn that the concept of declaring a subject before the actual statement is fairly uncommon. For example the statement "I am a student" in English, translates to がくせい です。 or (I am) a student. Unless there is a specific need to specify the subject, it is usually just implied.</p>

<p>In the case where I would want to make clear the subject I can use the particle word <em>wa</em> to make that distinction. To my understanding, particle words exists to help structure a sentence. For example the sentence はな さん は せんせい です。(Hana-san is a teacher) uses the particle wa (は)( typically the ha symbol is used in place for wa when used as a particle) connects the subject and the actual meat of the sentence.</p>

<p>Additionally forming a question seems to be easy since you simply add ka (か) to the end of a sentence, so the sentence せんせい です (I am a teacher) becomes せんせい ですか (Are you a teacher). As a side note, the book advises that question marks aren't typically used at the end of sentences, however online sources have conflicting opinions especially when including informal discussions. I'll have to look into that.</p>

<p>Finally in order to uses nouns the particle word no (の) is used in order to make the distinction so the phrase きょん くん の でんわ roughly translates to Kyon kun's phone. (or if we want to make Haruhi fans upset, きょん くん でんわ which is simply Kyon-kun Denwa~)</p>

<p>Japanese is definitely not something I'm going to learn overnight. I have issues dealing with the idea of looking at years of study. I just have a hard time visualizing timescales that large, even for things that I'm passionate about. For that reason, I'll simply continue to grind at these lessons/activies one day at a time. (How cliche...)</p>
