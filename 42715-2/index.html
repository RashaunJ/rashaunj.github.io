<p>Referencing my earlier post, I decided to start my cycle with Day A. The only adjustment I had to make was for the piano time considering that it hasn't even arrived yet. As an aside, I'm starting to notice a pattern in what these posts cover. As far as what I learned drawing-wise, it's hard to show without pictures and I don't have a convenient means of scanning images at the moment. My language learning on the other hand is very easy to write about. Additionally writing about software dev is easy considering that most if not all of my resources can easily be found online. I don't think this has any bearing on how I actually learn but I will try to stay cognizant regarding the frequency in which I focus on particular topics.</p>

<p>For today I covered the following areas: <br />
- Workbook Exercises (Genki)
- Expression Drawing Genki
- Light reading regarding general CS/Software dev concepts (read: I sat on Hacker News for a bit.)</p>

<p>The workbook exercise I covered was fairly straightforward. It gives a picture in which you have to fill out the appropriate greeting. This gave me the opportunity to work on both my vocab as well as my writing. I'm hoping to eventually commit hiragana to memory however I may need to find some rote memory device to aid in the process. The phrases themselves were fairly simply. They were basic phrases that would come up in everyday life such as すみません (I'm sorry/excuse me) and いってだきます (Thank you for the meal <em>before eating</em>). One of the things I'll have look into later is the use of the っ character used as a seperator between the first and second characters. I know it has something to do with double consonants, however I'd liek to find the exact reasoning. <br />
I don't have any issues with this format of teaching however I did become confused several times trying to figure out exactly what the people were trying to say. For example the "excuse me" picture could have had several phrases that could have potentially worked. This however is an extremely minor gripe. <br />
As far as the Loomis studies go, I'm just not getting into expressions. I feel this section will take much longer considering the detail he gives for each expression. Of course I'm in no particular rush to get this done but its worth nothing.</p>

<p>Lastly the most interesting CS-related article I found on HN was a series of analogies regarding CS concepts. For example, the concept of recursion was described as a person sitting in a movie theatre referencing their location based on the location of the person in front of them. Eventually the first/last person in the chain would say "I'm in row 1!". I don't have the link handy at the moment but I may edit it in at a later point.</p>

<p>So far so good. Progress is nice.</p>
