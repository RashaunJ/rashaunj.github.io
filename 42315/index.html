<p>This post will be on the more brief side of things. This is in part due to the fact that not much in the way of content was completed for today. I still <em>technically</em> got through my list for today, but it was in such a way that you immediately know that it could have been done in a much better fashion. I already know the cause for the this, but it is outside the context of this blog. Today I worked on two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hiragana practice</li>
<li>Drawing via Loomis</li>
</ul>

<p>I found an online flashcard application which uses the hiragana chart. This did not includes diacritical sounds nor contracted sounds however it served its purpose. Because I'm still learning, the excercise took more time than participated. One thing that I picked up is that I'm having a bit of difficulty picked up the different writing styles of hiragana. Not so much the formation of them in a sentence but how they are actually written. For example, two people may write the letter R in two distinct styles, however a person fluent in English will be able to distinguish the letter R no matter how sloppy/different the penmanship. I'll need to not only look at the style used in Genki but also online to get a firmer grasp on the letters. Hopefully in a few weeks time I'll be able to remember a good chunk of the hiragana and finally move on to katakana/kanji.</p>

<p>Loomis was rather uneventful simply because I didn't dedicate (too) much time to my drawing. I'll have to make up that time (probably at work). </p>

<p>On the topic of future talk, I have a fairly exciting purchase to make tomorrow. I'll finally be able to get a digital piano that I've had my eye on. In about a week's time I'll probably do a full rundown on how that went. Until then I'll focus on making a solid schedule for my studies. <br />
(oh an a final sidenote, I tend to write these fairly late, so the actual post date keeps being out of sync. I feel like that will become irksome eventuall)</p>
